# Drag Race Reckoner Database

This is the code for the database I'll need to make my Discord game and keep track of draft picks and player scores. I started with the code from [Scott Moss's Front End Masters course on GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/server-graphql-nodejs/), but I'll be editing it to use some modern JavaScript features (such as `.gql` importing) and, of course, show drag queens instead of cats and dogs.

I have not yet decided whether this repo will host just the database, or if it may also contain the Discord bot (Node.js) and the dashboard (Svelte).
